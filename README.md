# Predictive Maintenance
using machine learning algorithm to perform predictive maintenance task 

# Background
I will be using [the data from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset) about predictive maintenance. The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning algorithm in the context of reliability engineering.

## Objective
Prediction of whether mechanical part will fail is an important knowledge in the industry. The failure of mechnical component can disrupt and even stop the production flow in a factory, for example. Hence, developing a model that can be used to predict the failure of a mechanical part  can be important so that corrective and preventive action such as maintainance can be performed and planned to avoid production loss.

## Problem Statement
Q1: how to predict component failure without having to stop  the machine operation and perform destructive test?
